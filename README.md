# Secure-wirelesss-NAS-DIY
I built a NAS from scratch by disconnecting it completely from the internet through the whole building process using OMV as my Operating Software without sacrificing wireless capabilities through using an enclosed WIFI router to connect devices to my NAS. 2 x 1TB, 2x 512GB HDD for storage and a 1TB nvme as cache storage
